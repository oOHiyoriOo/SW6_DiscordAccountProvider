# SW6_DiscordAccountProvider
This plugin aims to Replace the Default Shopware Customer accounts with Discord.

To use this plugin you can put in your discord Authentication URL in the plugin config, 
but you still need to patch a little "bug" i left over, in the Controller is a default language ID set, 
that must be changed to match your shop, i'll add a fix / config field later.
